# Revy

Hi! It's register-based virtual machine. It can execute several commands, but it's just enough to be able to compute fibbonachi numbers! WIP

# Build

```
$ make
$ ./app.exe
```

# Next steps

1. It would be very convinient to add labels somehow

2. Add remaining instructions (div etc)

3. Add threaded code (computed goto)
